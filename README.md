# Custom hooks

React hooks are really cool!
I learn React and practice coding my own custom hooks

# 1. (useLogger, useLocalStorage - useState)

=> This first section of custom hooks I learned from instructors (WDS, F8) on Youtube

- Logger custom hook for useState and useReducer (check "useLogger.jsx")
- LocalStorage (useState) custom hook (check "useLocalStorage.jsx")

# 2. (useLSReducer - useReducer, useNavigateWithAPI)

=> This first section of custom hooks I coded it myself

- useNavigateWithAPI custom hook (check "useNavigateWithAPI.jsx" - I write some comments on how to use this custom hook in it's own file)
- LocalStorage (useReducer) custom hook (check "useLSReducer.jsx")
